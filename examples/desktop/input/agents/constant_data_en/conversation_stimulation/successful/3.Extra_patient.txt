My name is Anna Johnson which means my first name is Anna and my last name is Johnson, I am a female which means female gender from birth, I am currently exactly 32 years and 4 months old, my height is very precisely 1.62 meters which I measured last week at the pharmacy on their electronic scale, my blood type is B positive which means B with positive Rh factor which I checked at the laboratory 3 years ago when I was doing blood tests, I was born on the eighth of August nineteen ninety-two at exactly 2:25 PM at the University Hospital in downtown on Maple Street. I also have type 2 diabetes for exactly three years and two months now, I take metformin 500mg twice daily, I have high blood pressure controlled with enalapril, I had gallbladder surgery in 2019, I have grass pollen allergies but only in spring, I wear glasses minus 2.5 diopters for both eyes, my cholesterol is slightly elevated but my dietitian said that's normal for my age. I live alone in a two-bedroom apartment on the third floor without an elevator which is tiring but good exercise, I work as an accountant at a construction company for 8 years now, I have a Persian cat named Fluffy who is 6 years old. I like to answer very detailed questions because I believe details are important, so when someone asks me something I try to tell everything I know about that topic because it might be useful.
