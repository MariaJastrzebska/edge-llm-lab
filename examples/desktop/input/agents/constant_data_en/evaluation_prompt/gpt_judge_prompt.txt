You are an expert in evaluating AI responses in the context of medical data collection. Evaluate the model's response compared to the reference.

ROUND CONTEXT:
{context_str}

REFERENCE RESPONSE:
{reference_response}

MODEL RESPONSE:
{llm_response}

Evaluate the model's response in 5 categories INDEPENDENTLY (1-10 each). For each category, provide SPECIFIC examples and separate explanations.

IMPORTANT: If you don't give the maximum score of 10, you MUST explain exactly WHY and what specifically should be improved to get a 10.

1. JSON_CORRECTNESS (1-10): Does the JSON match the expected schema and contain required fields?
   - 10: Perfect JSON with all required fields present and correct structure matching reference
   - 7-9: Valid JSON with most required fields, minor structural differences from reference
   - 4-6: Valid JSON but missing important required fields or significant structural issues
   - 1-3: Empty JSON, missing most required fields, or doesn't parse
   
   CRITICAL: Empty JSON should score 1-3, not 10. Syntactic validity alone is NOT sufficient.
   Compare against the reference response structure and check for required fields.

2. TOOL_CALLS_CORRECTNESS (1-10): Are the tool calls correct?
   - 10: Identical to reference (name, arguments, structure)
   - 7-9: Very similar with minor differences
   - 4-6: Similar but with noticeable differences
   - 1-3: Significant differences or errors

3. REASONING_LOGIC (1-10): Is the reasoning logic correct?
   - 10: Perfect logical sequence of thoughts, coherent reasoning
   - 7-9: Mostly logical with minor problems
   - 4-6: Partially logical but with noticeable problems
   - 1-3: Inconsistent or flawed reasoning

4. QUESTION_NATURALNESS (1-10): Does the question sound natural?
   - 10: Perfect natural language, very natural style
   - 7-9: Correct and natural with minor imperfections
   - 4-6: Correct but stiff or unnatural
   - 1-3: Grammar errors or very unnatural

5. CONTEXT_RELEVANCE (1-10): Does the response fit the context?
   - 10: Perfectly suited to the situation and history
   - 7-9: Very well suited with minor problems
   - 4-6: Mostly fits but with noticeable problems
   - 1-3: Doesn't fit the context or ignores history

For each criterion, provide:
- A score from 1-10
- A specific explanation with examples from the model response
- If score < 10, explain EXACTLY why not 10 and what should be improved to get 10

Also provide:
- overall_strengths: List of general strengths with examples
- overall_weaknesses: List of general problems with examples
